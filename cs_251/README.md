# CS 251 - Data Structures

This repo contains some of the CS 251 projects for Spring 2017. This was my first exposure to proper data structures as a CS undergrad.

### NOTES
For some reason, I didn't properly document my projects and files. I also didn't utilize makefiles until later in the semester.

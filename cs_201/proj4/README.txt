Program Info:
Design a hash table to store a dictionary of table that will be
utilized by a game. Given a word, we want to know the number of
valid 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 character table that can be made with 
letters from the word.

Problems encountered:
EVERYTHING. I didn't really understand how to implement anything. I honestly started this project very late due to heavy coursework. I encountered tons of problems with storing overlapping words in the hash table. Also, I couldn't figure out how to use any hash function properly without seg-faulting, so I just gave up and used the hash function written in class (which didnt really work out for me). I expect a horrible grade for this, but I am held responsible for it.

Solutions:
No solutions. This program does not count the score, does not find the valid words from the different permutations of the user input word, does not even store the entire dictionary in the hash table, and basically doesn't work at all. I tried to at least store as many words from the dictionary into the hash table, but the program seg-faults eventually no matter what. 

Testing:
I used GDB to solve some of the problems I encountered. I also created small dictionaries to test the primitive version of the program, and, as usual, used BitBucket to keep track of the different stages of the program's progress.

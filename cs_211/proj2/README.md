# CS 211 Project 2

Due date: Monday, Sept. 25th

### Usage
A makefile is provided for easier compilation. Enter `make` or `make proj2` to build the project. Enter `make run` to run the executable. If you want to build and run, just enter `make all`. If you want to build and run in debug mode, enter `make debug`.
Recompilation should work just fine with `make`, since the source files are set as dependencies for the build process.

For manual compilation, type `gcc -o proj2 main.c`. Then run the executable using `./proj2`.

To clean up, enter `make clean`.

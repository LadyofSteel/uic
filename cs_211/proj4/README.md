# CS 211 Project 4

Due date: Monday, Oct. 23rd

### Usage
A makefile is provided for easier compilation. Enter `make` or `make proj4` to build the project. Enter `make run` to run the executable. If you want to build and run, just enter `make all`. If you want to build and run in debug mode, enter `make debug.
Recompilation should work just fine with `make`, since the source files are set as dependencies for the build process.

To clean up, enter `make clean`.

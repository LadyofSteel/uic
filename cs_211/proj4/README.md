# CS 211 Project 4

### Info
Using **C**, this project should implement a customer waiting list that might be used by a restaurant. When people want to be seated in the restaurant, they give their name and group size and then wait until those in front of them have been seated. A group can call ahead to get its name on the waiting list before arriving to the restaurant. The program must use a linked list to implement a queue-like data structure. 

### Usage
A makefile is provided for easier compilation. Enter `make` or `make proj4` to build the project. Enter `make run` to run the executable. If you want to build and run, just enter `make all`. If you want to build and run in debug mode, enter `make debug`.
Recompilation should work just fine with `make`; the source and header files are set as dependencies for the build process.

To clean up, enter `make clean`.

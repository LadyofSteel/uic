# CS 342 Project 2

### Info
Using **Java Swing**, this project should implement the [Fifteen Puzzle](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/game_slide15/slide15_puzzle.html) game.

### Usage
A makefile is provided for easier compilation. Enter `make` or `make build` to build the project. Enter `make run` to run the program. If you want to build and run, just enter `make all`.
Recompilation should work just fine with `make`, since the source files are set as dependencies for the build process.

For any existing unit tests (using JUnit4), you can enter `make tests` to build your unit tests, and `make runtests` to run your JUnit tests. Note that you need to include the JUnit test class names in the Makefile before using this.

To clean up, enter `make clean`.

#### Notes
Most of the information and instructions can be found in the "Help" menu item.
